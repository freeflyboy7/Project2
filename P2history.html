          <p id="para1">When Everest Base Camp opens for the spring climbing season in March, Prince Harry may be among the climbers hoping to conquer the world’s tallest mountain, according to The Telegraph.


          Climbing Everest is a bucket list item for many until they realize the great price involved—both monetarily and mentally. Because of the high cost, climbers usually range from the young, sponsored athlete to wealthy men in their late forties trying to battle personal demons, tackle insecurities, or otherwise satisfy some existential urges. I myself decided to tackle the world’s tallest mountain this year as a 30th birthday gift to myself. Like Prince Harry, I didn’t opt for a full climb of 29,029 feet, because I don’t have a deep interest in going past 26,000 feet, the so-called death zone where the fatality rate goes up exponentially. Otherwise I had a full Everest experience and can break down the financials in case Harry has inspired you to consider a climb.

          

          But Everest shouldn’t be measured in dollars and cents. A study by Ryan Howell, assistant professor of psychology at San Francisco State University, shows that people derive greater satisfaction from experiences rather than investing in possessions.  When I reached my goal after hours of breathless climbing and weeks on the mountain, I fell to my knees with tears of happiness as I listened to Nina Simone’s version of Here Comes the Sun. I scattered the ashes of a loved one and then pulled out pictures of those close to me that I brought as insurance in case something happened. This was a perfect moment in my life and replays over and over again.

          In fact, I never actually added up my Everest bills.  The mountain was where I figured out that I wanted to live my days as passionately as I can and to give as selflessly I can. The commitment I had to make to myself to achieve this climb spills over to my entire life and everyone in it. I’m fiercely loyal to my well-being, my career, and my relationships. Heck, I’m even devoted to my ex-boyfriends. I think Aleister Crowley said it best after a first attempt to climb K2: “I had done it myself and found not only that the pearl of great price was worth far more than I possessed, but also that the very peril and privations of the quest were themselves my dearest memories.”</p>
