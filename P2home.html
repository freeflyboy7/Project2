       <p id="para1">When Everest Base Camp opens for the spring climbing season in March, Prince Harry may be among the climbers hoping to conquer the world’s tallest mountain, according to The Telegraph. The 27-year-old prince trekked across the North Pole last year in an effort to raise money for Walking with the Wounded (WWTW), a U.K.-based charity that helps those who were injured while serving in the armed forces, and plans to join the WWTW Everest team .Mollie Hughes, one of the WWTW expedition team’s members who is hoping to become the youngest British woman climber at 21 to summit Everest, confirmed that the prince will be one of the climbers. “He won’t be doing the full climb, as it will take a long time and it requires rigorous training, so I think he’ll be joining us at base camp,” Hughes told The Telegraph.  It can take up to 10 days just to reach base camp from the south on the Nepalese side, the route Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay used to first conquer Everest in 1953. Once there, climbers usually spend six weeks on the mountain acclimating to the thin air and doing practice climbs before making the five-day summit push.

        But Everest shouldn’t be measured in dollars and cents. A study by Ryan Howell, assistant professor of psychology at San Francisco State University, shows that people derive greater satisfaction from experiences rather than investing in possessions.  When I reached my goal after hours of breathless climbing and weeks on the mountain, I fell to my knees with tears of happiness as I listened to Nina Simone’s version of Here Comes the Sun. I scattered the ashes of a loved one and then pulled out pictures of those close to me that I brought as insurance in case something happened. This was a perfect moment in my life and replays over and over again.
        In fact, I never actually added up my Everest bills.  The mountain was where I figured out that I wanted to live my days as passionately as I can and to give as selflessly I can. The commitment I had to make to myself to achieve this climb spills over to my entire life and everyone in it. I’m fiercely loyal to my well-being, my career, and my relationships. Heck, I’m even devoted to my ex-boyfriends. I think Aleister Crowley said it best after a first attempt to climb K2: “I had done it myself and found not only that the pearl of great price was worth far more than I possessed, but also that the very peril and privations of the quest were themselves my dearest memories.”</p><br>
