          <h5>Can anyone do this?</h5>
Not included in this estimate is the time that’s taken away from other things—you’ll be running three to four hours in 90 degree weather or climbing for six to eight hours in extreme conditions to prepare. In the months leading up, I became comfortable with the idea of working out two to three hours a day.

          <h5>What can should I bring?</h5>
Gear—$10,000
Everest is not the place to skimp on the grade of your down jacket.  Buying a cheaper featherweight on your summit mittens might cost you a hand to frostbite. I never knew gloves could cost $300 or that I would own two pairs of them.
          <h5>What can I expect when I get there?</h5>

An Everest climb starts at around $35,000 because mountain permits begin at $10,000 (the price varies based on the number in the expedition). In addition, a virtual village of Sherpas—porters, cooks, and guides—is required to get you to the top.  Fo $3,500 airplane ticket to get to Nepal, depending on whether you fly first class or coach.
          <h5>Will there be help in case of emergency?<h5>
A Sherpa takes home only $3,500 total for the climb. I treated mine to two yaks, which he named “Philip” and “Roth” after I introduced him to Philip Roth novels. You also have to purchase medical evacuation insurance, which starts at $500.
          <h5>Will there be help carrying supplies and gear?</h5>
A Sherpa takes home only $3,500 total for the climb. I treated mine to two yaks, which he named “Philip” and “Roth” after
