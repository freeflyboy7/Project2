	<p>It all began on a very cold winter evening in New York City, where a bunch of newbie coders sat in class learning and teaching each other how to code -- when we took breaks we talked about our stories, what got us into coding, our lives, the things that mattered to us and the things that we wer passionate about. Two of those things stood out to us, our love of coding and our love of animals. We wanted to do our part to help the many stray animals in our city and decided we would put our new coding skills to use by volunteering our time and new-earned skills to create pro-bono websites for local animal rescue groups. As more and more students joined the cause, we expanded our work to hosting hacking/fundraising nights. We're just a group of folks who love to code, learn together and give back to our furry friends. .</p>
